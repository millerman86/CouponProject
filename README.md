#CouponProject
This is my personal project for Helio Training.

ISSUES

###Mandatory
1. Create a skeleton user interface in an app that allows companies to upload their data and which can be easily scaled.
2. Create a filter that can filter through the companies based on certain criteria in a database.
3. Allow companies to enter their information by building a website.
4. Allow customers to enter their information for special deals and to join a loyalty program.
5. Build a group-on based coupon system for group discounts based on number of buyers or possibly shares.
6. Focus the most on the metadata and tags for enhanced filtering options and possible smaller tags.
7. Coupon codes.
